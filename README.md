# projection-networks

This repository documents the ACPNN (Action-Conditional Projection Neural Network) architecture, which is designed specifically to
simulate the natural mage formation system. Instead of using standard Convolutional networks, which generally work best for 
image formation/classification, this project tests a new architecture that has specific units structured to simulating the way a 3D scene 
is projected onto a 2D image.
